        <i>Abstract: For the cyclic group C<sub>2</sub> we give a complete description of the derived category of perfect complexes of modules over the constant Mackey ring <u>\(\mathbb{Z}/\ell\)</u>, for \(\ell\) a prime. This is fairly simple for \(\ell\) odd, but for \(\ell=2\) depends on a new splitting theorem. As corollaries of the splitting theorem we compute the associated Picard group and the Balmer spectrum for compact objects in the derived category, and we obtain a complete classification of finite modules over the \(C_2\)-equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum \(H\underline{\mathbb{Z}/2}\). We also use the splitting theorem to give new and illuminating proofs of some facts about \(RO(C_2)\)-graded Bredon cohomology, namely Kronholm's freeness theorem and the structure theorem of C. May.</i>

        <i>Abstract: Let \(C_2\) denote the cyclic group of order 2. We compute the \(RO(C_2)\)-graded cohomology of all \(C_2\)-surfaces with constant integral coefficients. We show when the action is nonfree, the answer depends only on the genus, the orientability of the underlying surface, the number of isolated fixed points, the number of fixed circles with trivial normal bundles, and the number of fixed circles with nontrivial normal bundles. When the action on the surface is free, we show the answer depends only on the genus, the orientability of the underlying surface, whether the action is orientation preserving versus reversing in the orientable case, and one other invariant.</i>

        <i>Abstract: In this paper, the authors build on their previous work to show that periodic rational  G-equivariant topological  K-theory has a unique genuine-commutative ring structure for G a finite abelian group. This means that every genuine-commutative ring spectrum whose homotopy groups are those of \(KU_{\mathbb{Q},G}\) is weakly equivalent, as a genuine-commutative ring spectrum, to  \(KU_{\mathbb{Q},G}\). In contrast, the connective rational equivariant K-theory spectrum does not have this type of uniqueness of genuine-commutative ring structure.

        <i>Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the image of the connective and periodic rational equivariant complex K-theory spectrum in the algebraic model for naive-commutative ring G-spectra given by Barnes, Greenlees and K&#281dziorek for finite abelian G. Our calculations show that these spectra are unique as naive-commutative ring spectra in the sense that they are determined up to weak equivalence by their homotopy groups. We further deduce a structure theorem for module spectra over rational equivariant complex K-theory.

        <p><i>
        Abstract: Let \(C_2\) denote the cyclic group of order 2. Given a manifold with a \(C_2\)-action, we can consider its equivariant Bredon \(RO(C_2)\)-graded cohomology. We develop a theory of fundamental classes for equivariant submanifolds in \(RO(C_2)\)-graded cohomology with constant \(\mathbb{Z}/2\)-coefficients. We show the cohomology of any \(RO(C_2)\)-surface is generated by fundamental classes, and these classes can be used to easily compute the ring structure. To define fundamental classes we are led to study the cohomology of Thom spaces of equivariant vector bundles. In general, the cohomology of the Thom space is not just a shift of the cohomology of the base space, but we show there are still elements that act as Thom classes, and cupping with these classes gives an isomorphism within a certain range.

        <p><i>Abstract: A surface with an involution can be viewed as a \(C_2\)-space where \(C_2\) is the cyclic group of order two. Up to equivariant isomorphism, all involutions on surfaces were classified in Bujalance et al. (Math Z 211:461-478, 1992) and recently classified using equivariant surgery in Dugger (J Homotopy Relat Struct 14(4):919-992, 2019). We use the classification given in Dugger (2019) to compute the \(RO(C_2)\)-graded Bredon cohomology of all \(C_2\)-surfaces in constant \(\mathbb{Z}/2\) coefficients as modules over the cohomology of a point. We show the cohomology depends only on three numerical invariants in the nonfree case, and only on two numerical invariants in the free case.</i>

        <h4>Rational equivariant K-theory for finite abelian groups</h4>
        <p>Given in the <a href="https://s.wayne.edu/echt/echt-research-seminar/" target="_blank">electronic Computational Homotopy Theory Seminar (eCHT)</a> in February 2021.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQFaK5z_K4E">Link to video recording</a> (45 minutes)</p>
        <p><i>Abstract: When working rationally, we can often translate topological questions to algebraic questions through the use of algebraic models. Recent work of Wimmer gives an algebraic model for rational genuine-commutative equivariant ring G-spectra for G a finite group. In this talk, we describe how we use this model to see there is a unique genuine commutative structure on rational equivariant K-theory for G an abelian group. This is joint work with Anna Marie Bohmann, Jocelyne Ishak, Magdalena K&#281dziorek, and Clover May.</i></p>

In this talk, we explain how a version of the Thom isomorphism theorem in \(RO(C_2)\)-graded cohomology in constant \(\mathbb{Z}/2\) coefficients can be used to develop a theory of fundamental classes for equivariant submanifolds. We then show these classes can be used to understand the cohomology of \(C_2\)-surfaces, including the ring structure.</i></p>
