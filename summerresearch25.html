    <h2>Summer Research 2025: Transfer Sytems</h2>
    <h3>About</h3>
    <p> This page has information and resources for my Summer 2025 research students at Grinnell. </p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Schedule</h3>
    <p>
    <b>Meeting Location:</b> Noyce 2402 will serve as our "research lab" for the summer. This classroom is reserved for us for the duration of our project. Unless stated otherwise, you can assume our meetings will take place in that room. <br><br>
        
    <b>Monday, June 9th</b><br> 
    <i>Note: I will not be on campus this day so we won't have any formal meetings. Instead, you have some assigned reading and problems that you should complete during your work block for this day. You're welcome and encouraged to meet without me though! </i>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Read these notes: <a href="Summer_2025_Notes.pdf" target="_blank">Posets, Hasse diagrams, and lattices</a>
        </li>
        <li> Complete the exercises in Section 4 to the best of your ability. You don't need to write up any formal proofs or anything. But you should have an outline for as many of the exercises you can. If you get stuck, come with questions. We will discuss the reading and problems on Tuesday.
        </li>

    <p>
    <i>Note: I do not expect you to read or even look at all of these papers! I am just collecting possible resources as they come to mind. We'll focus on certain papers/topics as the summer progresses. </i>
