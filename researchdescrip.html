    <h4 class="center">Short summary for mathematicians</h4>
    <p class="statement">My research is in equivariant homotopy theory, which is a subfield of algebraic topology. I study algebraic invariants for spaces with chosen symmetries, that is, spaces endowed with a continuous action by some fixed finite group. Much of my work has focused on spaces with order 2 symmetries, and the equivariant analog to singular cohomology, which is known as \(RO(C_2)\)-graded Bredon cohomology. </p>

    <h4 class="center">Summary for a broad audience</h4>
    <p class="statement"> My research is in a field of mathematics known as algebraic topology. Algebraic topology studies the different ways we can assign meaningful algebraic data to geometric objects. This allows us to then use algebraic tools to answer geometric questions that were otherwise inaccessible. Assigning numerical data to geometric shapes is a recurrent theme in mathematics: we can measure the slope of a line, the angles in a triangle, or the volume of a sphere. As the geometric objects we analyze increase in complexity, so do the data we need to describe them. Algebraic topology provides techniques to study properties of complex shapes, especially those in higher dimensions. While this may seem aimlessly abstract, higher dimensional objects appear in fields from data analysis to string theory, and one needs concrete ways to describe and measure their properties. (They are also just fun to think about!) </p>
    <p class="statement"> I study ways we can use algebraic data to analyze properties of geometric objects with a chosen symmetry (for example a circle has mirror symmetry). The algebraic data needed to capture properties of the geometric object <i>and</i> its symmetries is quite complicated, which is why mathematicians are just recently beginning to understand how these tools work. My research explores how we can concretely compute and understand this algebraic data. </p>
