    <h4 class="center">Short summary for mathematicians</h4>
    <p class="statement">My research is in equivariant homotopy theory, which is a subfield of algebraic topology. I study algebraic invariants for spaces with chosen symmetries, that is, spaces endowed with a continuous action by some fixed finite group. Much of my work has focused on spaces with order 2 symmetries, and the equivariant analog to singular cohomology, which is known as \(RO(C_2)\)-graded Bredon cohomology. </p>

    <h4 class="center">Summary for a broad audience</h4>
    <p class="statement"> My research is in a field of mathematics known as algebraic topology. Algebraic topology studies the different ways we can assign meaningful algebraic data to geometric objects. This allows us to then use algebraic tools to answer geometric questions that were otherwise inaccessible. Assigning numerical data to geometric shapes is a recurrent theme in mathematics: we can measure the slope of a line, the angles in a triangle, or the volume of a sphere. As the geometric objects we analyze increase in complexity, so do the data we need to describe them. Algebraic topology provides techniques to study properties of complex shapes, especially those in higher dimensions. While this may seem aimlessly abstract, higher dimensional objects appear in fields from data analysis to string theory, and one needs concrete ways to describe and measure their properties. (They are also just fun to think about!) </p>
    <p class="statement"> I study ways we can use algebraic data to analyze properties of geometric objects with a chosen symmetry (for example a circle has mirror symmetry). The algebraic data needed to capture properties of the geometric object <i>and</i> its symmetries is quite complicated, which is why mathematicians are just recently beginning to understand how these tools work. My research explores how we can concretely compute and understand this algebraic data. </p>

        <i>Abstract: Let G be a finite group and V be a G-representation. We investigate the RO(G)-graded Bredon cohomology with constant integral coefficients of the space of ordered configurations in V. In the case that V contains a trivial subrepresentation, we show the cohomology is free as a module over the cohomology of a point, and we give a generators-and-relations description of the ring structure. In the case that V does not contain a trivial representation, we give a computation of the module structure that works as long as a certain vanishing condition holds in the Bredon cohomology of a point. We verify this vanishing condition holds in the case that dim(V)â‰¥3 and G is any of C<sub>p</sub>, C<sub>p<sup>2</sup></sub> (p a prime), or the symmetric group on three letters.  </i>

        <i>Abstract: We prove that Hill's characteristic function \(\chi\) for transfer systems on a lattice \(P\) surjects onto interior operators for P. Moreover, the fibers of \(\chi\) have unique maxima which are exactly the saturated transfer systems. In order to apply this theorem in examples relevant to equivariant homotopy theory, we develop the theory of saturated transfer systems on modular lattices, ultimately producing a "matchstick game" that puts saturated transfer systems in bijection with certain structured subsets of covering relations. After an interlude developing a recursion for transfer systems on certain combinations of bounded posets, we apply these results to determine the full lattice of transfer systems for rank two elementary Abelian groups. </i>

This is fairly simple for \(\ell\) odd, but for \(\ell=2\) depends on a new splitting theorem. As corollaries of the splitting theorem we compute the associated Picard group and the Balmer spectrum for compact objects in the derived category, and we obtain a complete classification of finite modules over the \(C_2\)-equivariant Eilenberg-MacLane spectrum \(H\underline{\mathbb{Z}/2}\). We also use the splitting theorem to give new and illuminating proofs of some facts about \(RO(C_2)\)-graded Bredon cohomology, namely Kronholm's freeness theorem and the structure theorem of C. May.</i>

This means that every genuine-commutative ring spectrum whose homotopy groups are those of \(KU_{\mathbb{Q},G}\) is weakly equivalent, as a genuine-commutative ring spectrum, to  \(KU_{\mathbb{Q},G}\). In contrast, the connective rational equivariant K-theory spectrum does not have this type of uniqueness of genuine-commutative ring structure.

        <p><i>
        Abstract: Let \(C_2\) denote the cyclic group of order 2. Given a manifold with a \(C_2\)-action, we can consider its equivariant Bredon \(RO(C_2)\)-graded cohomology. We develop a theory of fundamental classes for equivariant submanifolds in \(RO(C_2)\)-graded cohomology with constant \(\mathbb{Z}/2\)-coefficients. We show the cohomology of any \(RO(C_2)\)-surface is generated by fundamental classes, and these classes can be used to easily compute the ring structure. To define fundamental classes we are led to study the cohomology of Thom spaces of equivariant vector bundles. In general, the cohomology of the Thom space is not just a shift of the cohomology of the base space, but we show there are still elements that act as Thom classes, and cupping with these classes gives an isomorphism within a certain range.
