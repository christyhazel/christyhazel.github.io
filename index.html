        <p> I am a Clare Boothe Luce Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/math">mathematics  deparment</a> at <a href="https://www.grinnell.edu/">Grinnell College</a>. I do research in algebraic topology with a focus on equivariant homotopy theory. A lot of my research involves trying to compute and understand algebraic invariants for spaces endowed with an action by some fixed finite group. Check out my "Research" tab for more information and links to my papers. </p>
        
        <p>I am co-organizing the Grinnell Math and Statistics Student Seminar in Spring 2025. If you are a Grinnell student who has done some math or statistics research you'd like to share, please reach out! Our seminar meets Thursdays 12-1PM, and we have speakers from Grinnell and other nearby universities. Seminar is open to all math-interested Grinnellians!</p>
            
        <p> Before Grinnell I did lots of math on the West Coast. From 2020-2023 I was a Hedrick Assistant Adjunct Professor at UCLA in the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">mathematics department</a> working with <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/~mikehill/" target="_blank">Mike Hill</a>. I was also involved with the <a href="https://s.wayne.edu/echt/">electronic Computational Homotopy Theory (eCHT)</a> online research community and supported as a National Science Foundation (NSF) eCHT Reasearch Training Group Postdoctoral Fellow. Before that I was a graduate student at Univeristy of Oregon from 2014-2020. I finished my PhD in 2020 at the <a href="https://math.uoregon.edu/" target="_blank">University of Oregon</a> under the supervision of <a href="https://pages.uoregon.edu/ddugger/" target="_blank">Dan Dugger</a>.
        
        <p> My "Teaching" tab has information about my current and past courses taught at Grinnell, UCLA, and UO.</p>
